# ITCS208 - Project 2 - MoogleMobile (Bonus)
A student project. Mahidol University, Faculty of ICT: `ITCS208 – Object Oriented Programming`. 2017

This project is an extended implementation for [Moogle](https://github.com/rektplorer64/ITCS208-P2_Moogle) with a graphic user interface built as an Android Application.
The app itself has no structure; Everything is contained inside specific Activities.

###### Dependencies
1. **`RecyclerView`** → For the list of the Movie
2. Multiple **`Activity`** classes → Main Page, Movie Profile, Movie Search, Movie Review Page
3. File Operations → handled by the Java Library; 
   ∴ There is no Database Implementation → The App will take a long time when loading for the first time.
